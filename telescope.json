 'q_sum': 'About the performance of Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular in low light for watching feeding owls at dusk and after.',
 'multi_answers': ['These binoculars are quite good. I use it for astronomic observation, so I point it to the light. I think you will perform great with this binocular for dust. They have clear view and easy handling.',
  "Not the best. Definitely there are worse but there are better available if that is your main purpose. I would say these are comparable to slight better than naked eye vision at dusk, but magnified of course.. Some binocs gather light exceptionally well and make things visible that arent even possible with naked eye at dusk. These binocs perform best in high light, that's where the clarity and detail rreally really shine here in my opinion. For all-around use they are GREAT.",
  'I use these binoculars for astronomy, the ultimate low light challenge. Not quite as good as high end binoculars, but excellent performance for the price.',
  'I use these binoculars for hunting. I find them very usefull for the price also in low light.',
  "Hi again Wm. I see you've gotten a fair spread of replies. I purposely went outside at dusk this evening and panned across my pine and oak forest property so I could get a sampling of light and shadow. I could make out good detail at maximum viewing distance. There are probably more expensive products out there, but in this price range, these are probably as good as it gets.",
  "I personally think they would perform perfectly, since mine do. You can always order them and check them out at dusk then if they don't work for you, return them. I would honestly consider the unarmored version as they are lighter but should be the same quality optics. I use the armored at night when I can't see holes in the ground and fall down a lot which messes up my unarmored binos. Go for it and let me know your decision.",
  "These are great. Low light sightings are clear. You can't go wrong. Also look up at the stars and moon at night. Want believe what's up there. You want regret this purchase.",
  "They are a decent set of bino's, ok glass but they are very heavy to hold for extended periods of time. I would spend the extra $ and go With the Nikon Monarch's instead, better glass, more detail and not so heavy."],

 'product_reviews': ["I bought a set of the Nikon 8x40 Action Ex for my girlfriend and I liked them so much I decided to get a pair for myself. Not wanting to get the exact same ones she had, I decided to 'upgrade' to the 10x50. The 10x50 are about 200g heavier and significantly larger as well. Overall I found that they were too hard to stabilize, and the focus mechanism too slow with too much resistance. In the end, the extra magnification provided little advantage as the image was not any clearer than the 8x40, and the image was much less stable. In the end, I returned the 10x50 for another pair of the 8x40 Action Ex and I couldn't be happier.",
  'I bought this binoculars as a replacement for the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bushnell-Falcon-10x50-Wide-Angle-Binoculars-Black/dp/B000051ZOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bushnell Falcon 10x50 Wide Angle Binoculars (Black)</a>. I am glad that I did. I know it is unfair to compare both, but if you can afford the Nikon, you should! The difference of about one hundred dollars is justified by better construction, nitrogen filled fog proofing, better eye relief and warranty among other things. One thing that my wife misses is the ease of focus control (with Insta-Focus) on the Bushnell. Nikon needs a little bit more "turning the focus". If you have a slippery / sweaty hands after a long hike, it might cause some issues (the rubberized handle does help a little). On a overall level, I love this binoculars. Highly recommend it.',
  "Lovely Binoculars! Great for Stargazing and astronomy! I was torn between getting the Nikon Action in either the 7x50 model or the 10x50. I ended up trying out both, and the 10x50 is absolutely wonderful for astronomy! It's incredible how many more stars you can resolve in the night sky with 10x magnification! You can really tell the difference that the BAK-4, multicoated lenses make here, the image is sharp, vivid, colorful, and clear!",
  'I\'ve hunted and birded with these for about 10 years now and they are simply great. I tried "upgrading" to a Vortex 10x50 and returned then after a side-by-side comparison. These Nikon EXs just have better optical quality, *noticeably* better, and they\'re $100 dollars less. They are the tried-and-true porro prisms, which people don\'t think are sexy anymore with roof prisms being all the rage, but I just want rugged, waterproof binocs that\'ll give me high-quality viewing. These deliver and have stood up to years of hard use on all my travels.',
  'WOW, after all the telescopes I have tried and some binoculars these are keepers, I have a pare of bushnell 10x50 and they were only 55.00 but these Nikons really stand above and they were shipped over night. I swear I can see a bug crawling on a dead tree limb about 200 yards away an very clear, no sh. At 150.00 you cant go wrong with these, I read a lot of reviews and the specks of others before buying these, almost bought another bushnells before finding these. Cant wait to bring to on our trip to upper UP along the lake an in the woods.',
  'Excellent! This is my 11th binocular in my present collection, my 3rd Nikon and my 2nd AE. I also have the 7x35 wide angle AE. This 10x50 is wider than most of this size with 6.5 degrees. Very sharp to within 15% of the edge and pretty light to hold. I am very satisfied. I tested it on globular Cluster NGC 6397 -- nice detail! Highly Reccomended!',
  'I bought the Nikon Action 10x50 binoculars to replace an old "no name brand" pair my father gave me 30 years ago. I didn\'t use the old ones regularly until we moved to the Gulf coast. The old binoculars were in sad shape so I ordered the Nikon. Wow was I surprised. Bright, clear view, true color, I didn\'t know binoculars could work so well. The EX Extreme is easy to focus, easy to adjust and light enough to carry around all day. The case that comes with them doesn\'t provide much protection I\'ll be looking for something better for travel. I\'m looking forward to taking them on my next sailing trip.',

 'knowledge': ['Binoculars with larger objective lens diameter and lower magnification such as 10x50 are generally better in low light conditions.',
  'The larger objective lens diameter of 50mm means that these binoculars can gather a lot of light in low light conditions, which makes them a good choice for watching in twilight and early in the morning.',
  "Binoculars can be heavy and difficult to hold steady for an extended period, so it's worth considering tripod mounts or image stabilization technology to prevent camera shake.",
  'Magnification tells you how big an object appears in the binoculars. In this case (10x), an object will appear 10 times closer than it would with the naked eye.',
  'The durability of binoculars is important for outdoor activities. The Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular is designed for extreme all-terrain use.',
  'The quality of the lenses in binoculars is crucial. The Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular has high-quality multi-coated lenses for bright, clear images.',
  'The wider the field of view, the easier it is to find and track moving objects. The Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular has a wide 341-foot field of view at 1000 yards.',
  'The diameter of the exit pupil determines how bright an object appears in low light. The exit pupil of these binoculars is 5mm, which is large enough to provide a bright image in low light conditions.',
  'The focusing mechanism of binoculars should be easy to use and precise. The Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular has a central focus knob that is easy to reach and use.',
  'The eye relief is important for users who wear glasses. The Nikon 7245 Action 10x50 EX Extreme All-Terrain Binocular has an eye relief of 17.2mm, which is suitable for most eyeglass wearers.']}
